## Part 2: Laravel Folder Structure

### app

This directory contains the core code of your application. This is where all your custom classes, exceptions, controllers, middleware, providers, and traits live.

### bootstrap

The bootstrap directory contains the app.php file which bootstraps the framework. It also houses the cache files for speed optimization.

### config

In the config directory, you'll find all of the configuration files for your application. This is a great place to look for various settings defined by Laravel and your own custom settings.

### database

This directory contains your database migration and seeds. It's also where you would store all your SQLite databases, should you choose to use SQLite.

### public

This is the directory that your web server points at. It contains the index.php file, which is the entry point for all requests entering your application.

### resources

The resources directory houses your views, raw assets (LESS, SASS, CoffeeScript), and localization files.

### routes

All of the route definitions for your application are housed in the routes directory. By default, several route files are included with Laravel: web.php, api.php, console.php, and channels.php.

### storage

The storage directory contains your compiled Blade templates, file-based sessions, file caches, and other files generated by the framework. This folder is segregated into app, framework, and logs directories.

### tests

This directory contains your automated tests. An example PHPUnit is provided out of the box.

### vendor

The vendor directory contains your Composer dependencies. It is also the default location for package development.

By understanding the purpose of each folder in the Laravel framework, you can better navigate and manage your projects. Always keep in mind that the Laravel framework is very flexible, and these directories can be configured to your liking.
